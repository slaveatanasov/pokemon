Hi!

I managed to complete the assignment with some minor bugs which are:

* Searching by type works only if the whole word is written in the input; I couldn't figure how to use map on the types array in the models file in node.
  Load More increases the size limit to the query, independently of the after variable in GraphQL query (adds +5 to current value);
  Reset resets the limit to 8.
* I slightly changed the code in the backend, because it was a bit confusing due to libraries used.

This took me a few days because it is the first time I used GraphQL, Apollo, React with TypeScript (only regular .js so far), and the libraries used in Node.js;

My experience so far was mostly REST APIs with Angular.

Thanks for reading. :)
